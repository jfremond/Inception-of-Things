This project is a minimal introduction to Kubernetes. It aims to deepen our
knowledge by making us set up several environments under specific rules using
Vagrant, K3s, K3d and Argo CD.

It is divided in three parts respectively named p1, p2 and p3.
-	p1: K3s and Vagrant
-	p2: K3s
-	p3: K3d and Argo CD
